Certainly! A suitable project-based assessment for beginner-level DApp development should be engaging and educational, allowing participants to apply the knowledge and skills they've acquired throughout the course. Here's a project idea:

**Project Title: Simple Voting DApp**

**Project Description:**
Participants will build a decentralized voting application (DApp) using Ethereum and Solidity. This project will focus on the core concepts of DApp development, including smart contracts, user interfaces, and interactions with the Ethereum blockchain.

**Project Objectives:**
1. Develop a functional DApp that allows users to create and participate in simple online votes.
2. Apply smart contract development skills in Solidity.
3. Create a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the DApp.
4. Implement security best practices to protect against common vulnerabilities.

**Project Requirements:**
Participants should build the following components for their Simple Voting DApp:

1. **Smart Contract:** 
   - Create a smart contract that handles the voting logic.
   - Define functions for creating polls, voting, and retrieving poll results.
   - Ensure security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

2. **User Interface (UI):**
   - Develop a web-based UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Implement functionality for users to:
     - Create new polls.
     - Vote on existing polls.
     - View poll results.

3. **Integration with MetaMask:**
   - Allow users to connect their MetaMask wallet to the DApp.
   - Enable users to sign transactions (casting votes) using MetaMask.

4. **Testing:**
   - Conduct thorough testing of the DApp to ensure its functionality and security.
   - Include test cases to cover various scenarios (e.g., different poll options, multiple voters).

**Project Evaluation Criteria:**
Participants will be assessed based on the following criteria:

1. **Functionality:** Does the DApp work as expected? Can users create, vote in, and view poll results?

2. **Code Quality:** Is the code well-organized and easy to understand? Does it follow best practices for Solidity and web development?

3. **Security:** Has the participant implemented necessary security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, unauthorized access)?

4. **User Experience:** Is the user interface intuitive and user-friendly? Does it provide clear instructions to users?

5. **Integration with MetaMask:** Does the DApp effectively integrate with MetaMask for secure transactions?

6. **Documentation:** Is there clear documentation explaining how to use the DApp?

**Project Presentation:**
Participants should also be required to present their Simple Voting DApp to the class, demonstrating its functionality and discussing design decisions and challenges they encountered during development.

This project-based assessment will not only reinforce the knowledge and skills learned during the course but also give participants a practical understanding of building decentralized applications for the blockchain.
